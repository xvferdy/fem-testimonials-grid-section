The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my

careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”`;

I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
100% recommend! ”`;
