							The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
							life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
							careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

						</h2>

							“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
							I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
							programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
							student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
							program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
							were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
							The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
							learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
							have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
							example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
							job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
							100% recommend! ”
